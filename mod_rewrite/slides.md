> Despite the tons of examples and docs, mod_rewrite is voodoo. Damned
cool voodoo, but still voodoo.
>  -- Brian Moore

---

![Wizard](images/wizard.gif)
And numerous websites offer mod_rewrite advice that is much more akin to
magic than science.

        RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} \
            ^205\.209\.177\.
        RewriteRule .* - [F]

---

![algebra](images/algebra.gif)
I'd like to show you that mod_rewrite is a clear, concise,
algebraic notation, not a magical incantation.

## Regular Expressions

![mre](images/mre.jpg)

- Atomic description of text patterns
- Start with a small vocabulary and work up
- Essential building block of mod_rewrite syntax
- PCRE
note:: Mastering Regular Expressions, Jeffrey Friedl

---

## .

- Wildcard character
- Matches one "atom"
- In mod_rewrite syntax, it matches a 'character'
- Use \\. if you want to match a literal "."

---

## Tangent

- 'Character' vs 'Byte'
![chinese](images/chinese.jpg)

---

![axb](images/axb.png)

---

## +/\*/?

- Repetition characters
- Turns an atom into a molecule

---

## \+ - One or more

![aplus](images/a+.png)

---

## \* - Zero or more

- a\* matches zero or more 'a' characters
- a
- aaaaa
- Also matches "Fish", which contains zero 'a' characters

---

## ?

- Makes a match optional
- That is, matches zero or one

---

![color](images/colour.png)

---

## ^ and $

- Anchors
- Starts with
- Ends with

---

![anchora](images/anchora.png)

---

![anchor2](images/anchora2.png)

---

## ^$ and ^

- ^$ is a special case - matches empty string
- starts with ends with (nothing between)
- ^ (all by itself) matches every string (including empty string)

---

## ( )

- Turns several atoms into a molecule (grouping)
- Can apply repetition characters to this molecule
- `(ab)+` matches "abababab"

---

## ( )

- Also "captures"
- The matched set of parentheses becomes $1
- The next one $2, and so on
- Examples in just a moment

---

## [ ]

- Character class
- Match one of these things

---

![coat](images/coat.png)

---

## Not

- Any regex can be negated in a RewriteRule or RewriteCond by putting a ! in front of it
- A character class is negated with a ^

        [^abc]
Matches anything EXCEPT a, b, c

---

## mod_rewrite

- mod_rewrite uses regular expressions to match requests, and modify them in some way
- (And a lot of other things)

---

## RewriteRule

RewriteRule PATTERN TARGET

---

## RewriteRule

RewriteRule *PATTERN* TARGET

If it matches *this*

---

## RewriteRule

RewriteRule PATTERN *TARGET*

Do *this* instead

---

## RewriteRule

RewriteRule PATTERN TARGET *[flags]*

With some optional *tweaks*

---

![rewriterule](images/syntax_rewriterule.png)

---

## Syntax

RewriteRule *PATTERN* TARGET

- *PATTERN* is a regular expression (usually)
- Applied to the REQUEST_URI
- That's everything after http://hostname
- May be modified by context (eg, .htaccess files) or by earlier rewrite rules

---

## Syntax

RewriteRule *PATTERN* TARGET

- *TARGET* is where you want it to go instead
- File path, or URI, or something else, depending on context and flags

---

## Examples

    RewriteRule ^/images/(.*)\.jpg \
        /pics/$1.gif [R=301]

---

## Flags

- Modify behavior of a RewriteRule
- Default is to treat it as a file path relative to current location

---

## [R]
- Forces an external redirect, optionally with the specified HTTP status code. 
- Issues a redirect header to the client - URL in browser changes

        RewriteRule ^/images/(.*)\.jpg /pics/$1.gif [R=302]
        RewriteRule products http://products.example.org/ [R=301]
note:: 302=temp, 301=permanent

---

## [PT]
- Forces the resulting URI to be passed back to the URL mapping engine for processing of other URI-to-filename translators, such as Alias or Redirect.
- Treat the target as a URI, processing it for URI-type things

        RewriteRule ^/products/(.+?)/ /prod.php?$1 [PT,L]

---

## [B]
- Escape non-alphanumeric characters *before* applying the transformation.
- Preserves special characters in the URI through the rewriting process

---

## [C]

- Rule is chained to the following rule. If the rule fails, the rule(s) chained to it will be skipped. 
- Use this when you need to do several transformations in a row as part of a single logical operation.

---

## [CO]

- Sets a cookie in the client browser. 

        RewriteRule ^/index.html - \
        CO=fontdoor:1:example.com

- Full syntax is: 
        CO=NAME:VAL:domain[:lifetime
            [:path[:secure[:httponly]]]] 
- *-* as the target means "don't rewrite"

---

## [DPI]
- Causes the PATH_INFO portion of the rewritten URI to be discarded. 

---

## [ENV]

- Causes an environment variable VAR to be set (to the value VAL if provided). 
- The form !VAR causes the environment variable VAR to be unset.

        RewriteRule \.(png|gif|jpg)$ - [E=image:1]
        CustomLog logs/access_log combined env=!image

- Example: Don't log images

---

## [F]
- Returns a 403 FORBIDDEN response to the client browser.

        RewriteRule \.exe - [F]

---

## [G]
- Returns a 410 GONE response to the client browser. 
- I've never actually used this flag.

---

## [H]

- Causes the resulting URI to be sent to the specified Content-handler for processing. 

        RewriteRule ^(/source/.+\.php)s$ \
          $1 [H=application/x-httpd-php-source]

- Example causes .phps requests to be processed by PHP's syntax-highlighter

---

## [L]
- Stop the rewriting process immediately and don't apply any more rules.
- Probably doesn't do what you expect in per-directory and .htaccess context
- (see also the END flag).

        RewriteBase /
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !=/index.php
        RewriteRule ^(.*) /index.php?req=$1 [L,PT]

---

## [END]
- Stop the rewriting process immediately and don't apply any more rules.
- Also prevents further execution of rewrite rules in per-directory and .htaccess context. 
- (Available in 2.3.9 and later)
- Note that a rule issuing a REDIRECT to itself will still result in rules being re-run

---

## [N]
- Re-run the rewriting process, starting again with the first rule, using the result of the ruleset so far as a starting point. 

        RewriteRule (.*)A(.*) $1B$2 [N]
- Example - global search and replace of A with B, looping until there's no more As
- Use [N=100] to limit to 100 iterations (2.4.8 and later)

---

## [NC]
- Makes the pattern comparison case-insensitive.

        RewriteRule (.*\.(jpg|gif|png))$ http://images.example.com$1 [P,NC]

---

## [NE]
- Prevent mod_rewrite from applying hexcode escaping of special characters in the result of the rewrite. * Not to be confused with [B]

---

## [NS]

- Causes a rule to be skipped if the current request is an internal sub-request. 

---

## [P]
- Force the substitution URL to be internally sent as a proxy request. 

        RewriteRule (.*\.(jpg|gif|png))$ http://images.example.com$1 [P,NC]
- Proxy to back-end image server

---

## [QSA]
- Appends any query string from the original request URL to any query string created in the rewrite target.
- That is, it preserves the user-submitted query string, in addition to the one you created

        RewriteRule /pages/(.+) /page.php?page=$1 [QSA]

---

## [QSD]
- Discard any query string attached to the incoming URI. 

---

## [S]

- Tells the rewriting engine to skip the next num rules if the current rule matches.
- Like a GoTo statement for rewrite rules
- Consider using `<If>` and `<Else>` instead

        # Is the request for a non-existent file?
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        # If so, skip these two RewriteRules
        RewriteRule .? - [S=2]
        RewriteRule (.*\.gif) images.php?$1
        RewriteRule (.*\.html) docs.php?$1

---

## [T]
- Force the MIME-type of the target file to be the specified type. 

        # Serve .pl files as plain text
        RewriteRule \.pl$ - [T=text/plain]

---

## .htaccess files
- .htaccess files are for local (per-directory) configuration
- mod_rewrite assumes you only care about the current directory
- Leading directory path is stripped off of everything

---

Syntax in .htaccess files:

        # In httpd.conf
        RewriteRule ^/images/(.+)\.jpg /images/$1.png

        # In .htaccess in root dir
        RewriteBase /
        RewriteRule ^images/(.+)\.jpg images/$1.png

        # In .htaccess in images/
        RewriteBase /images/
        RewriteRule ^(.+)\.jpg $1.png

---

## RewriteCond
- Additional condition on a rewrite
- Can consult any variable, not just REQUEST_URI
- Can evaluate arbitrary expressions

---

![cond](images/syntax_rewritecond.png)

---

Redirect based on client address

        RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} ^10\.2\.
        RewriteRule (.*) http://intranet.example.com$1

---

# Backreferences

        RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} (.*)
        RewriteRule ^/(.*) /sites/%1/$1

---

## Flow
![backref](images/rewrite_backreferences.png)

---

## -f and -d
- `-f` - Is it a file?
- `-d` - Is it a directory?

        RewriteCond /var/www%{REQUEST_URI} !-f
        RewriteCond /var/www%{REQUEST_URI} !-d

        RewriteRule ^ /index.php [PT,L]

index.php can examine `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` for the original request

---

## Others
- -s - is a file with non-zero size
- -U - resolves to a valid URL - This is SLOW
- -x - is an executable file

---

## LA-U
- Look-ahead for a variable that hasn't been set yet
- For example, use this for auth user, which is set *after* rewrite phase

        RewriteCond %{LA-U:REMOTE_USER} (.+)
        RewriteRule (.*) http://people.example.org/%1/$1   [R,L]

---

## Expresions
- Evaluate arbitrary logical expressions

        RewriteCond expr "! %{HTTP_REFERER} \
            -strmatch '*://%{HTTP_HOST}/*'"
        RewriteRule ^/images - [F]

---

## RewriteMap
* External map which can be used in a RewriteRule
- 1-1 mapping
- DB lookup
- Some kind of programmatic thingy

---

## RewriteMap

    RewriteMap MapName MapType:MapSource
eg.

    RewriteMap examplemap txt:/path/to/file/map.txt
    RewriteRule ^/ex/(.*) ${examplemap:$1}

---

RewriteMap example

        RewriteMap product2id \
            txt:/etc/apache2/productmap.txt
        RewriteRule ^/product/(.*) \
             /prods.php?id=${product2id:$1|NOTFOUND} [PT]

---

Map file

        ##
        ## productmap.txt - Product to ID map file
        ##
            
        television 993
        stereo 198
        fishingrod 043
        basketball 418
        telephone 328
